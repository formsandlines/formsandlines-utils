# formsandlines utils

<br/>

Module for common utility functions that I use in my formsandlines projects.

Use with caution for some of them may be unfinished or broken. Also keep in mind that not all of these functions are well-written and you would probably be better off with a more general and professional utility library like [Lodash](https://lodash.com) or [Underscore.js](https://underscorejs.org).

Many of these functions are written by myself, but some are taken from Stack Overflow and other sources, sometimes with my own adjustments and additions.

If you see a piece of code here that may be taken from a source without proper credits, please notify me so I can change that. Although I always try to specify my sources, there may be cases where the original source was missing or falsely attributed in the location where I got the code from.
